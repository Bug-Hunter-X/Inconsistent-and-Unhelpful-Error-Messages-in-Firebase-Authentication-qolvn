The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the sign-in process.  The error messages aren't always very descriptive, making debugging difficult. For example, an invalid email or password might result in a generic 'auth/invalid-email' or 'auth/wrong-password' error, without specific details on what is wrong. Network connectivity problems may lead to a timeout error.  Another common problem is when using FirebaseUI for authentication and the UI doesn't give feedback on the error to the user.  This makes it hard to debug from a user perspective.
