This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: unhelpful error messages. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how the Firebase Authentication SDK can return vague errors, making it hard to identify the root cause of sign-in failures.  The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution by implementing more robust error handling that provides more specific feedback to the user. This includes handling network errors, checking credential validity before sending requests to Firebase, and displaying user-friendly error messages based on the specific error codes.  Contributions are welcome!
